# myflix

Myflix is a clone of Netflix. Users of Myflix can create an account, search and stream videos, as well as add videos to their 'My List'. This app was built using React, Redux, and Rails. All video/animation content was created by me during my time as the videographer/editor for grammy-nominated artist Ryan Leslie.
