# README
KumaFlix is an inspired clone of NetFlix, utilizing videos('movies') I created during my time as the videographer and editor for grammy-nominated artist Ryan Leslie. Users of Kumaflix are able to create accounts, search and stream videos, as well as add videos to their 'My List'. Kumaflix was created with React, Redux, and Rails. Below is a live link to Kumaflix as well as breif segments on the technologies used.
